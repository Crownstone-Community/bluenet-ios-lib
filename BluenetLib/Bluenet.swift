/**
 * Bluenet.
 * This lib is used to interact with the Crownstone family of devices.
 * There are convenience methods that wrap the corebluetooth backend as well as 
 * methods that simplify the services and characteristics.
 *
 * With this lib you can setup, pair, configure and control the Crownstone family of products.
 
 * This lib broadcasts the following data:
   |  topic:                        |     dataType:        |     when:
   |  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   |  "bleStatus"                   |     String           |     Is emitted when the state of the BLE changes. Possible values: "unauthorized", "poweredOff", "poweredOn", "unknown"
   |  "setupProgress"               |     NSNumber         |     Phases in the setup process, numbers from 1 - 13, 0 for error.
   |  "advertisementData"           |     Advertisement    |     When an advertisement packet is received
   |  "verifiedAdvertisementData"   |     Advertisement    |     When an advertisement has been decrypted successfully 3 consecutive times it is verified.
   |                                |                      |     Setup and DFU are also included since they dont need to be decrypted. This sorts out only your Crownstones.
   |  "nearestSetupCrownstone"      |     NearestItem      |     When a verified advertisement packet in setup mode is received, we check the list
   |                                |                      |     of available stones in setup mode and return the closest.
   |  "nearestCrownstone"           |     NearestItem      |     When a verified advertisement packet in setup mode is received, we check the list
   |                                |                      |     of available stones in setup mode and return the closest.
